# Image Classification Using Vision Transformers

## Overview
This project demonstrates **image classification using Vision Transformers (ViTs)**. It provides a comparative analysis with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of ViTs. Vision Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms, whereas CNNs rely on convolutional operations for feature extraction.

## Features
- Implements **Vision Transformers** for image classification.
- Compares performance with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
- Uses **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face Transformers** for model implementation.
- Demonstrates data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and model comparison.
- Can be extended to different datasets with minor modifications.

## Installation
Before running the notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers matplotlib
```

Ensure you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Dataset
The project can be used with datasets like **CIFAR-10**, **ImageNet**, or any custom dataset. Modify the dataset loading section in the notebook to use a different dataset.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cnn_vs_ViT.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells in order to preprocess data, train both models, compare their performance, and evaluate results.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)

## Results & Evaluation
The notebook includes model performance metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Loss curves
- Comparative analysis between CNN and ViT

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **Hybrid Models** (CNN + Transformer).
- Explore different transformer architectures (e.g., Swin Transformer).
- Fine-tune on custom datasets.
