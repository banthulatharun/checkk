# CNN vs Vision Transformer (ViT) Comparison

## Description

This project explores the differences in performance between a simple Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook
cnn_vs_ViT.ipynb details the implementation and comparison of these models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Installation

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy

## Usage

To run the notebook, upload cnn_vs_ViT.ipynb to Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and execute
the cells sequentially.
